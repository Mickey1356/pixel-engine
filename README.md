# OpenGL 2D Pixel Engine

A pixel engine inspired and heavily adapted from [https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

Made for learning on how to do actually create such an engine. Also for me to prototype whatever I want to.

More information when the engine is actually completed/functional.

Done:
- Engine window

Todo:
- Canvas rendering
- Keyboard/Mouse input
- Drawing functions
- Drawing text
- Drawing images
- Sound?
